    <p class="dialogue">The university auditorium. Daniel, now in a cap and gown, stands at the podium. His family sits in the front row, cheering loudly.</p>
    <p class="dialogue" data-audio="audio/Scene 8/Daniel/dialogue1.mp3">Daniel: “This degree isn’t just mine. It belongs to my parents, who never gave up on me. To Carlos, who kept me smiling. And to my community, who showed me the power of support. Thank you all for believing in me.”</p>
    <p class="dialogue" data-audio="audio/Scene 8/Crowd_cheering.mp3">(The crowd erupts in applause. Maria and Jorge hug each other, tears streaming down their faces.)</p>
